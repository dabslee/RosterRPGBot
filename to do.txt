ToDo:
- RSVPs
- RollCalls
- Automated Priority Reset
- HUGE: Code Revision, RosterBot V2.0

Bugs:
- Peeps can't sideline themselves or each other as 'fixed'. Is this working at all?



To Done 25/09/20:
- There was an error in clean_games: 'tz' 8:00am. 2020 09 24 07 48 11.log
- List object is not callable, 3:49am. 2020 09 24 03 47 01.log
- can only concatenate str (not "int") to str 3:30am. 2020 09 24 03 30 01
- 'completed' 2:56am 2020 09 24 02 57 33.log
- Bright Dawn has a "setting" dictionary at the end. Delete it.

To Done 17/09/20 (and sometime before this):
- Better Bot controls for me
- Better log sharing to me
- Bot now publishes it's online offline status to whatever gamepublishchannel is set (if any) for each guild

To Done 12/09/20:
- Create a more user friendly way of making new games (guided command interface)

To Done 07/09/20:
- Fixed Audit Roster to demote lower priority players (not just check eligibility)
- Edited embed colouring so that red is only for unpublished games
- If sidelines are turned off while there are players sidelined, it just puts a strikethrough the names in the embed
- Enabled a setting for the Server Owner to set: GMs only edit their own games. Authority role 1 can edit any
- Created Game Reminders and added to bot loop

To Done 06/09/20:
- Finished Audit Roster loop
- Enhanced error reporting

To Done 03/09/20:
- Schedule regular auditing of games and ensuring players are eligible for the games they're in

To Done 02/09/20:
- Listme, Rosterme, and SidelineMe functions
- Revise the roster and sideline functions of GMs
- Message players if their rostered/sidelined status has changed as a result of someone using list/roster/sideline me
- Message players according to the whispergmrosterupdates, whispergmsidelineupdates, whisperplayersrosterupdates, and whispersidelinerosterupdates

To Done 01/09/20:
- Fixed a bug where editing your own timezone changed everyone's timezone
- Create an authority level for editing completed games and making games incomplete
- Better connection/uptime logging

To Done 30/08/20:
- Report errors to me as a DM in Discord
- Allow copying of games
- Let changes to published games delete and repost an updated embed
- Message players of updates to games
- Allow storing, setting, and using of Player Timezones
- Reset Priorities command

To Done 25/08/20:
- Find out why Roster me was giving class TypeError
- Allow !roster and !rb interchangably
- format and upload the readme.txt as a word doc
- Find out why !roster default doesn't output the embed for default (something to do with empty embed values)
- Find out why timezone conversion went the wrong way (+9 rather than -9 hours from GMT+10 to GMT+1)
